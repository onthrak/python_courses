I need some music
I got the music
I need a melody
So here's a melody

Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving
Through my whole body (feel the melody)
Sound, it takes me higher to another place
Lose control of myself when I hear the bass

So let the bass kick

When I'm listening on my headphones (all alone)
I'm taken to another world (other world)
Makes me feel like I can fly
Like I cannot ever die
Music is my only drug

Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving
Through my whole body (feel the melody)
Sound, it takes me higher to another place
Lose control of myself when I hear the bass

(Music is my only drug)
So let the bass kick

Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving
Through my whole body (feel the melody)
Sound, it takes me higher to another place
Lose control of myself when I hear the bass

I need some music
I got the music
I need a melody
Well here's a bassdrum

When I'm listening on my headphones (all alone)
I'm taken to another world (other world)
Makes me feel like I can fly
Like I cannot ever die
Music is my only drug

So let the bass kick

Can you feel the music and the melody?
I can feel it moving
Through my whole body (feel the melody)
Sound, it takes me higher to another place
Lose control of myself when I hear the bass
