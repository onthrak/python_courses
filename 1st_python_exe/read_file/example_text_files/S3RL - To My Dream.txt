Take me to my dreams (my dreams)

I taste the rainbow in the sky
I see the sounds as they pass me by
I'm falling through time as it flies away

Take me to my dreams (my dreams)
Show me what this lifetime means
I see inside and open my mind

And hear the echoes of future's past
I feel like I can understand it all

Take me to my dreams (my dreams)
Show me what this lifetime means
I see inside and open my mind
Take me to my dream, show me what's real
